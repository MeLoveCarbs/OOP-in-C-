# OOP-in-C++
This repo contains useful information regarding OOP in C++:
Default constructors, destructors, overloaded ctors, dtors used in class design
Operators overloading, ostream, istream ctors
Virtual ctors, dtors used in polymorphism
Inheritance of classes
Smart pointers: unique ptrs, shared ptrs
And a few mini topics as well.
Things to take note of are sometimes written beside the lines of code in the form of comments(very useful notes).

**Note that i did this as a beginner practicing on OOP C++, so it definitely isn't something to lean upon for learning legitimately.**
